    <h3>1. Reduce Depression</h3>
    <br>

When we remove ourselves from nature, our innate emotional relationship<br>
 with other living beings, known as “biophilia,” is hampered. Merely viewing<br>
  nature scenes is enough to remind us of how expansive and soothing a direct <br>
experience with nature is. When we do not have access to natural beauty, we shut down.
</p>
<p><h3>2. Give Your Brain a Break</h3>
    In addition to depression, spending your time in a concrete jungle quickly<br>
     becomes monotonous. We have an innate need for novel experiences that artificial<br>
      environments fail to give us. In the short term, they can be <br>
      stimulating and exciting, but in the long run, they <br>
    do not give us all of the things our brain needs for excitement and novelty.</p>
    <p><h3>3. Heal Faster</h3>
        A 2013 article in The Atlantic profiled a small suburban Pennsylvania hospital <br>
        that had several rooms facing a small courtyard and several others facing a boring<br>
         old brick wall. Hospital administrators began to notice that patients in rooms<br>
         that were facing the courtyard were recovering much faster than those viewing the brick wall.</p>
